# Maze_game
This is a maze-like game that hides some cool arcade games references. I had a lot of fun building it for university.
I know that I should have spread the code around more modules but for this simple game I felt like it wasn't necessary.
It makes use of the turtle graphics module mostly but I implemented some other cool features via threading, platform specific actions
(now it's high time I specify that the music only works on Windows, if you use Unix or something else the sounds won't work but hopefully 
everything else works) and some simple algorithms that rely on the following modules: time, random, math.
Have a go at completing the game! (or maybe add a few levels of your own and challange me to them haha :) )
I should also add that this is the most documented piece of code I've ever written (the professor wanted it that way :/)
